# Customer Churn Prediction with Explanation and Email Generation
Overview
This project is designed to predict customer churn using various machine learning models and provide personalized customer support. The application:

Utilizes multiple machine learning models (such as XGBoost, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.) to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving (churning).
Explains the predictions in a user-friendly manner using an LLM (Llama model), summarizing why a customer may be at risk of leaving without technical jargon.
Generates customer-facing emails to engage customers and improve retention without mentioning the prediction directly.
